# 🚀 DSA-Daily - Journey to Mastering Data Structures & Algorithms  

This repository documents my **daily progress** in solving **DSA problems**, starting with fundamental concepts and advancing towards more complex challenges.

## 📅 **Day 1: Basic Math Problems**  

On the first day, I focused on **basic mathematical problems**, improving my understanding of number operations and mathematical logic.  

### ✅ **Problems Solved:**  
1. **Count Digits** - Finding the number of digits in a given number.  
2. **Reverse a Number** - Reversing the digits of an integer.  
3. **Check Palindrome** - Checking if a number reads the same backward as forward.  
4. **GCD or HCF** - Finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers.  
5. **Armstrong Numbers** - Identifying numbers that satisfy the Armstrong condition.  
6. **Print all Divisors** - Listing all divisors of a given number.  
7. **Check for Prime** - Determining if a number is prime.  

### 📌 **Approach & Learnings:**  
- Used **loops, modulus, and division operations** to solve these problems efficiently.  
- Explored different methods to find **GCD** (Euclidean algorithm).  
- Optimized **prime number checking** by iterating only up to **√N**.

## 📅 **Day 2: Recursion Basics**  

On the second day, I focused on **recursion**, understanding how functions call themselves and solving problems using **base and recursive cases**.  

### ✅ **Problems Solved:**  
1. **Understand Recursion by Printing Something N Times**  
2. **Print Name N Times using Recursion**  
3. **Print 1 to N using Recursion**  
4. **Print N to 1 using Recursion**  
5. **Sum of First N Numbers using Recursion**  
6. **Factorial of N Numbers**  
7. **Reverse an Array using Recursion**  
8. **Check if a String is Palindrome or Not using Recursion** (Medium Difficulty)  
9. **Fibonacci Number using Recursion**  

### 📌 **Approach & Learnings:**  
- Understood **base cases** and how recursion terminates.  
- Solved **printing problems** to understand recursion flow.  
- Implemented **array reversal** and **palindrome check** using recursion.  
- Learned about **Fibonacci sequence** implementation recursively.
